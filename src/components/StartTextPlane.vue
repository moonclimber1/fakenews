    Do you see a pattern? How is the game played? Do not trust the media/ The media lies Against all enemies foreign and domestic
    System of control? Apply logic and common sense You awake, thinking for yourself, is their greatest fear Enjoy the show Follow
    the white rabbit Do you get it yet? They are afraid of you (about Qanon being banned) Don't believe everything you read. Why
    do you believe what you believe? Whould you be able to recognize “them” decieving you? What if entertainment was more than
    just entertainment? (brainwashing) What if the people in charge didnt have our best interests in mind? Who is influencing our
    media? Are you really free?
